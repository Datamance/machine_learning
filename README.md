# machine_learning

Bare-bones "academic" implementations of Machine Learning models.

The purpose of this repository is decidedly *NOT* to provide performant machinery for prediction-making and computational statistics, rather, it is a purely selfish excercise for me to be able to learn and clearly explain how certain models work. I also use this repository to explore public & experimental datasets, so some of the data may not be loaded into this repo.
